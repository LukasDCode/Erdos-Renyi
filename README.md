# Random Network Models
personal implementation of a Erdos-Renyi and a Barabasi-Albert model to generate a random graph

## Usage
To run both the Erdos-Renyi or the Barabasi-Albert model the script can just be run as it is.
```
python random_graphs.py
```
# > :warning: **If you are running the script as it is**: Execution takes very long (~1h), because the Barabasi-Albert Models take a very long time!

In order to run only one of them, the other block of code has to be commented out from the main()-method.
